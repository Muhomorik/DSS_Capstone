# Foreword #

This is a final project for [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) at Coursera.


## Final words ##

I am slightly disappointed by the SwiftKey for ignoring the project.

I think there should be provided a set with predicted values to train a model.
Because predicting the Quiz results without being able to evaluate a model first is... tricky.

My model predicts values based on the current set, but it took me **16 HOURS** to build it on 30% corpus.

Nevertheless, I learned a lot by working on it and I hope it will help me somehow in the future.
Also, I would have done it different next time.

## Overview ##

* Some numbers
* Prediction
* How it works (short)

## Some numbers ##

NGrams by N-size chart and creation time for each ngram table in hours.

```{r chartNgramSize, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

par(mfrow=c(1,2)) # rws, cols

# db part
con <- SQLiteGetConn(db_name)
q1 <- QueryStringStatusTable()
res <- dbGetQuery(con, q1)
invisible(dbDisconnect(con))

#draw the histogram with the specified number of bins
barplot(res$GramsSize,
        names.arg = res$nGram,
        main = "NGrams count", xlab = "ngram", ylab = "ngram count")

res$runtime <- round(res$runtime, 1)
#draw the histogram with the specified number of bins
barplot(res$runtime,
        names.arg = res$nGram,
        main = "NGrams build time", xlab = "ngram", ylab = "HOURS")


```

Same table in text, the scaling defines the size of corpus (2 means 1/2 of file).

```{r tableNgramSize, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=4, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

pander(res)

```

```{r dbFileSize, echo=FALSE}

# Calculate the longest row in file.
size.db <- humanReadable(file.info(db_name)$size, standard="SI", unit="MB")

```

For storage, the SQLite database is used. Db stores values in binary format.
That is very compact and only takes **`r size.db`**.

## Prediction {#foo}

App uses a simplest Stupid Back-off prediction scheme. First it tries to find a
matching four-grams and if it fails - goes down to trigrams, bigrams and unigrams. 
Size of bars shows appr. ngram size.

The tricky past was filtering the twitter set because it includes lot's of
typos, hash tags (appr. 60%) and web pages. In fact, words like: "aaaaaghhhhh" are still in prediction
table because they are widely used, but have a very low values.

My own tests shows 68-75% coverage for bigrams depending on skip-grams and test set.

To illustrate the idea all intermediate steps return prediction.

![predictionScheme](myimg/StupidBackof.png)

I am using [quanteda](https://github.com/kbenoit/quanteda) package and `inversemax`
 weightening scheme described here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf–idf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf–idf).

![weight_inversemax](myimg/weight_inversemax.png)

The inverse document frequency is a measure of how much information the word provides, that is, whether the term is common or rare across all documents. Basically, as a term appears in more documents, the ratio inside the logarithm approaches 1, bringing the idf and tf-idf closer to 0.

In other words, in this application lower values is better.

## How it works (short) ##

![how_works_short](myimg/Prediction.png)

Pre-processed values are stored in the SQLite database and accessed using the 
[RSQlite](https://github.com/rstats-db/RSQLite) package.

User input is spitted and filtered into the variables that are passed to the query 
builder and SQLite database. The result (last row) is returned.

## How it works (long) ##

![app](myimg/App.png)

The app includes offline part, pre-processing database, and online and online part, app.

Offline part and pre-processing are described in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Muhomorik/DSS_Capstone).

Some top predictors are listed in the Examples section, try entering them slowly and
see how values changes.
